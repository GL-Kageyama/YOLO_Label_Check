# YOLO Label Check

It was given this name because the image is processed only once compared to previous methods.

Basic YOLO is capable of detecting 80 labels.

In this verification, we will examine how YOLO performs image recognition on these 80 labels.

"toaster" and "hair drier" were not recognized.

Please verify it, too.

note : I used YOLO ver.3.

# YOLO Label Check

It was given this name because the image is processed only once compared to previous methods.

Basic YOLO is capable of detecting 80 labels.

In this article, we will examine how YOLO performs image recognition on these 80 labels.

In this verification, "toaster" and "hair drier" were not recognized.

The YOLO used is ver.3.

Please verify it, too.
